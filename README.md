###### Cricket
**Playing cricket has helped me develop qualities like hard effort, determination, and team spirit.**
Cricket encourages each player to understand their team members, and this development makes them
more supportive and works towards the greater good. **The three aspects of the bat and ball sport known  as cricket are batting, bowling, and fielding.** There are 11 players on each of the two teams that compete in cricket.
